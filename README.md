# Cloud Servers

A package for simulating cloud-like URLs.

### Usage



Directories are relative to the `cloud-servers` workspace directory (`process.cwd()`), so you can reference other directories on your local machine. For example:

#### Mac OS/Linux

	asdfafsd

#### PC

	...example to come...

Alternately, just dump your cloud files into the CDN folder, and start it up. No configuration necessary. (All contents in the CDN folder are ignored.)
